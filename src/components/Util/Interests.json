  "Music": "I'm an avid Guitar player, I love playing songs from Nirvana, Metallica and that general genre. I'm not the best at it but it's a great alternative interest when I wanna get away from the tech world.",
  "Games": "I'm a huge fan of RPGs, I love games like Skyrim, Fallout, and the Witcher, Cyberpunk 2077 def made a huge comeback for me too. I'm also competitive in games like CSGO.",
  "Coding": "Well Obviously I'm a Software Developer, I love working on projects that involve both the Frontend and Backend. I love working with React, Node, and Express, they're kinda my bread and butter.",
  "Tech": "Before I was a programmer, I was (and still am) an avid computer technician, I love working with hardware and software, I built my own PC when I was about 14 and I love working with new tech, you can never have too much processing power (Unless you're bottlenecking I guess)."
